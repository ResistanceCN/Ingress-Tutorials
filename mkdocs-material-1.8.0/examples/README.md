# Examples

To run the example configurations, ensure Python and MkDocs are up and running,
change to the respective directory and run `mkdocs serve`. This will print:

``` sh
INFO    -  Building documentation...
INFO    -  Cleaning site directory
[I 170620 18:54:55 server:283] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000
[I 170620 18:54:55 handlers:60] Start watching changes
[I 170620 18:54:55 handlers:62] Start detecting changes
```

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to see the resulting documentation.
